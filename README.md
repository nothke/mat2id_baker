## Note
This plugin requires python PIL module. Since Blender may not permit adding modules to its internal folder by default, you'll have to do it manually:

1. Install pillow: `python -m pip install â€“upgrade Pillow`
2. Copy PIL folder from your python site-packages folder to your blender version's `\python\lib` folder
